# Reverse Polish Notation

Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz,[1] who invented Polish notation in 1924.[2][3] [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation "Wiki")
